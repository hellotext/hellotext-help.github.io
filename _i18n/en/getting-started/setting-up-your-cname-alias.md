## Short Links

<div class="note">
    Note: Short Link aliasing is part of the <i>White Glove</i> feature. Refer to our <a class="active" href="/pricing">Pricing</a> page for more information.

Hellotext generates ShortLinks that are used to collect customer information and track their activity on their site. 
With Short Links, you can know which Campaign or Journey sent the message to the customer, when did they click the Short Link,
and where they were redirected to. 

By default, Hellotext generates Short Links using the domain `hello.link`. Short Links will be displayed in the following format
when sending to customers: `hello.link/XXXXXX`.

Aliasing a Short Link allows you to specify a specific domain to use instead of `hello.link`. 
For example, if you own the domain `mydomain.com`, you can alias your Short Links to use `mydomain.com` instead of `hello.link`.
Then, when generating Short Links, Hellotext will use the domain you specified instead of `hello.link`. 
Short Links will be displayed in the following format when sending to customers: `mydomain.com/XXXXXX`.
