If you have a store on the Wix platform, you can easily connect it to Hellotext.

By connecting your Wix store, you will be able to track all your customers' activities, automatically creating profiles with their data and feeding them with their activities such as abandoned carts, completed orders, and more.

With this information, you can create segmented audiences and much more effective promotional campaigns.

## Connect your Wix site

From the Hellotext dashboard, go to the *Settings* section and click on *Integrations*.
