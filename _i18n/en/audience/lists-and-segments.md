As your business start growing the list of contacts and subscribers, you will likely want next to learn how to organize and segment them in ways that will make it easier to reach them.

Hellotext provides two easy ways to organize your subscribers: lists and segments.

In this guide you will learn the differences between the simple concept of lists and the powerful segments, capable of segmenting your audience based on specified criteria automatically and in real-time.

## Lists

Lists are the simplest way to organize contacts and subscribers. 

They are convenient way to group contacts together and its ideal when you just starting with a few contacts and managing them manually is not a problem.

## Segments

As the number of contacts start to grow you may find it difficult to organize them manually. To make this easier and really take your audience targeting to its next stage, we recommend using Segments.

Segments leverage all the recorded events performed by your audience and let you create automatically updated lists of subscribers based on who they are and what they do.

You can segment between the characteristics of your subscribers (like location, age, gender), their behavior (what they purchased, how much they spent) or any possible combination of both. 

It takes less than one minute to start creating segments like:

* *Loyal customers who spent over certain amount during a period of time.*
* *Everyone who have not made a purchase over the last 30 days.*
* *Those who viewed or purchased products in certain categories.*
* *People living near certain location.*

And even more creative combinations like:

* *Women from Montevideo interested in bags and beauty products who have not purchased over the last 90 days*. 

Segments are updated in real-time and always contain those subscribers matching the current conditions specified. 

We recommend using Segments for building the specific demographics that you want to reach in your promotional campaigns.
