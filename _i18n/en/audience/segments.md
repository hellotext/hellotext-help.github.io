Segments let you create lists of subscribers based on conditions which are automatically managed in real-time without having to do it manually.

Reach your audience based on their characteristics (like location, age, gender) , their behavior (what they purchased, how much they spent) or any possible combination of both.

Segments are updated in real-time and always contain those subscribers matching the current conditions specified.

We recommend using Segments for building the specific demographics that you want to reach in your promotional campaigns.

## Type of segments

### Subscriber's Characteristics

These are the properties of your subscribers. You can provide this information using any of the Integrations available or providing them from your source or CRM using the API.

* **Gender**
* **Age** 
* **Location**: Select cities, entire regions or countries.
* **Device**: If subscribed via a web capture such as a pop-up or if clicked on short link o the tracker is installed on your website and the subscriber is associated to the session it is possible to target by kind of device (desktop, mobile, tablet), device brand, OS.
* **Mobile operator**
* **Subscription method**: How they subscribed to your list: keyword, short code or phone number, QR code or capture.
* **Custom properties**: Any custom defined property that you previously created.

### Subscriber's Activity

Actions performed on your audience can be used for segmentation and are in fact one of the most powerful and effective ways to segment.

Some actions like when a short link is clicked as automatically tracked as events. If you connect your eCommerce website with one of our ready-to-go implementations like Mercado Libre you will benefit for real-time reporting events performed by your subscribers such as the products they purchased and the amount spent. 

Some examples of activities you can use for segment:

* **Clicked on a short link**: When a subscriber clicked a short link from a message campaign you have sent. 
* **Viewed a product or visited a page** 
* **Added items to the cart**
* **Purchase a product**
* **Installed an app**
* **Completed a form** 
* **Custom actions**: Any custom action created by you.
