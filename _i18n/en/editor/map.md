The map tool is one of the various tools available in the Hellotext Editor. 
With this tool, you can easily share your location with your customers. 
This is useful for sharing your store's location, a meeting point, or any other location you want to share.

### Prerequisites

The map tool will only be enabled when you have enabled an integration that supports Geolocation. For example, 
SMS do not support Geolocation, so the map tool will not be available when creating an SMS message. However,
WhatsApp supports Geolocation, so the map tool will be available when creating a WhatsApp message.

Right now, of the integrations we support, only WhatsApp supports Geolocation. 

### How to use the map tool

The map tool can be identified with the <img style='display: inline;'  src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/editor/map.svg"> icon.
Clicking on the icon reveals a map that you can interact with to pinpoint the desired location you want to send to your customer.

Once you have chosen the desired location, compose the message you want to send, or select Enter to send the location without any additional text.

### Using accurate location {#accurate-location}

The map tools initially shows a location based on your IP address. This location may not be accurate to the street level.
If you want an accurate location, you can click on <img style='display: inline;'  src="{{site.url}}/images/icons/editor/aim.svg"> icon to get your exact location.
