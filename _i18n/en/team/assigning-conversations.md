Assigning conversations allows you and your team to have a clear chain of responsibility for each conversation at any given moment making it easier to understand which conversations every one is expected to take care. 

This helps to reduce response times and increase both customer and team satisfaction as it becomes more clear who is expected to respond to any given conversation. 

Typically, team members take care of any unassigned conversation and those assigned to them. As a rule, everyone takes responsibility of the conversations assigned to themselves. 

When someone feels that the conversation requires to be handled by someone else in the team, he can just re-assign it to the appropriate member. 

### Assign a conversation to me

Select a conversation from the *Inbox*.

Conversations that remain unassigned can be easily assigned to yourself by simply clicking on the *Assign to me* button near the top right of the conversation. 

A more convenient alternative is to simply reply on the conversation. As long as the conversation is still unassigned it will be automatically assigned to you when you send a message.

If the conversation is already assigned to someone else, you can re-assign it to yourself by clicking on the three dots near the top right of the conversation, select *Assign* and then select yourself from the list. 

### Assign a conversation to another team member

Select a conversation form the *Inbox*.

Click on the three dots near the top right of the conversation, select *Assign* and then select the team member that you want to assign the conversation to.
