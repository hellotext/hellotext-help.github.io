You can obtain exclusive mobile phone lines that are immediately ready-to-use. 

You can use these dedicated numbers to send your campaigns, receive messages from customers and setup WhatsApp.

## How to obtain a number

From the *Settings* page, visit the *Numbers* from its menu on the left side of the page. 

From the Numbers section, *Set up a new number*.

A new wizard will guide you through the process. 

The steps can be summarized as:

1. Choose the country you want to obtain a number from. If you want to obtain numbers in multiple countries you need to repeat this process for every country.
2. On the next step, select the option *Get a mobile phone number* and continue.
3. Choose from the list of available numbers the one that you want to use. 
4. Continue to the review page and if everything is correct confirm to get your number. 
5. Your number is now associated to your business and it is immediately available for you to use.

We recommend testing that it works by sending a text message to the new number. 

You can see and manage your numbers from the *Numbers* page.
