One of the most powerful marketing techniques is the ability to track what your customers do when they interact with your brand, being at your site or your store. Tracking your customers actions is as important for reporting as it is to also reach them more precisely with promotions and with active selling by your team.

One of the key aspects that makes Hellotext unique is its ability to easily track all the important actions that your customers perform from any source that matters to you: that can be what they do at your eCommerce site, your physical retail shop or in any other valuable interaction.

They are grouped by their kind of action and separated by a dot. 

For example, examples of actions are:

### Product actions

* `product.purchased` A product has been purchased.
* `product.viewed` A product page has been viewed.

### Coupon actions

* `coupon.redeemed` A coupon was redeem by a customer.

### Refund actions

* `refund.requested` A customer requested a refund.
* `refund.received` A refund was issued by you to your customer.

### Page views actions
