If you need more control over your journeys, custom journey are here to help. 

While we have a range of pre-defined templates to cover common journey needs, custom journeys give you the possibility to create more expressive automations better adjusted to your needs.

You can see custom journeys as an empty canvas that you configure from scratch.

To get started, visit the *Journeys* section and click *New Journey*, then choose the *Custom Journey* option.

### Select a trigger

To select the trigger for your journey, follow these steps:

1. Click on the circle labeled *Journey Begin*. This will open a pane on the right-hand side.
2. Choose the action that the customer must perform to initiate the journey. You can select from our pre-defined actions or use a custom action you have created.
3. Click *Confirm* to set the trigger.

With the trigger in place, you can now start adding steps to your journey.

## Steps explained

Journeys are processed in a sequential order, moving from one step to the next. 

To add a step to your journey, simply drag it from the left area and place it between two existing steps on the black line in the middle. The new step will be inserted in between those steps.

There are various types of steps available to choose from:

### Send a message 

The *Send a message* step allows you to send a message to the customer. 

You can include shortlinks, tags, and coupons in your message. 

If the journey was triggered by an event associated with a product (such as adding an item to a cart or making a purchase), you can use tags specifically targeting those products.

### Condition

The *Condition* step lets you set rules and criteria that must be met in order for the journey to continue on its current path. If the criteria are not met, the journey will branch off onto a different path. 

This is a great way to customize the flow of the journey based on different conditions. You can create multiple branches from the same condition step.

### Wait 

"The *Wait* step is a timer that pauses the journey until the specified time has elapsed. By default, journeys do not have any waiting time, so all steps are processed one after the other.

For example, you can use a wait step to set a two-hour delay before sending a cart abandonment reminder after someone adds an item to their cart.

## Saving and publishing the journey

To save your changes to the journey, click the *Save Changes* button in the top right corner of the page. 

By default, all journeys remain in draft mode until they are published.

When you are ready to activate the journey, click *Publish*. To deactivate the journey later, click *Make inactive*."
