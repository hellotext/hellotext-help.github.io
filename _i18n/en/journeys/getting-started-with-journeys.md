With journeys, you can set up automated processes that are activated based on your customers' interactions with your business.

Journeys are a powerful tool for engaging with your customers and driving more sales.

For example, you can create a journey that sends a welcoming message with a coupon code to customers when they subscribe. You can also use journeys to recover abandoned carts by sending a reminder message with a discount a few hours after a customer leaves items in their shopping cart.

Journeys are extremely flexible and their possibilities are endless. We provide you with a range of pre-designed templates that you can easily activate for the most common scenarios, but you can also create completely custom journeys from scratch.

### How journeys work

Journeys are triggered by actions taken by your customers. You can start any journey based on any action, including custom actions that you define.

Journeys progress through a predetermined series of steps in a specific order. These steps can include text messages, conditions that allow you to divide the journey into different paths, and intervals of waiting time.

## Create a journey

To create a new journey, visit the *Journeys* section and click on the *New Journey* button.

You'll be presented with a selection of templates to choose from. Select the one you want to use and you'll be taken to the journey editor.

The flow of the journey will be displayed, starting with the trigger and proceeding through each step. You can customize any of the steps as needed.

Click on *Save Changes* to save your work. Don't worry, the journey is still not active at this point.

When you're ready, you can press *Publish* to activate the journey. If you need to deactivate it later, you can click on *Make inactive*.
